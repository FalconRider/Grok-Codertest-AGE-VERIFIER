Can you give me the code for an html page, with a little CSS to make it pretty,
and whatever JavaScript, flask  or python you need to make it work.

It would function as an

Age checker driven by todays date

A large bold title "You are 19 if born before:" and 

there would be a line stating "Today is" and today's date

You are 19 if you were born:( and the calculated date )

The calculated date is arrived at by using the systems current date and subtracting 19 years.

Please spell out the day of the week in full text


It would be a stand alone app that
 would not need a server, or a webpage that could be called up
 from a bookmark in Chrome on an android phone

There  would be a Button  that says "Hit Me"

The button would clear any previous display  and show a new recalculation.

So today, if I hit the button, I'd get 

You are 19 if born before: "December 20, 2005" ( if correct)
and hold it till hit again or shut down

Yesterday

You are 19 if born before: "December 19, 2005" ( if correct)





Ask me questions if you need to, go to code, in a single  html file with imbedded CSS and JS , when you have what you need.
